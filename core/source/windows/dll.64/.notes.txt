Functions of the assembler being used by front-end code:

assembly_init
assembly_pass
assembly_shutdown
get_output_length
read_from_output
write_output_file
show_display_data
show_errors

These are handled by far calling a thunk into the assembler.



The following functions are called from within the 32-bit assembler:

get_environment_variable

malloc
malloc_fixed
malloc_growable
mfree
realloc
get_timestamp

open
lseek
read
write
close

display_string
display_error_string

These functions are all located in 'system.inc' and are handled by far calling their 64-bit counterpart.



Because the is 64-bit the lower bound on Windows API availablity is quite high compared to the 32-bit version.
